## Description

Urban Palate is an interactive front-end prototype simulating a modern online food ordering website. It allows users to sign up, log in using various methods, browse a menu fetched from a cloud database, manage a shopping cart, and place simulated orders. This project demonstrates the integration of front-end web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with backend services provided by Firebase (Authentication and Firestore Database).
